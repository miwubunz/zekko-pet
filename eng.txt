## poke:

>////<

Hehe~

*giggle*

Poke poke poke! Hehe, it tickles!

You're my favorite human! :3

*boing* Did I bounce? Hehe, that was fun!

Prrr...~

*squish* Oh, did I just wiggle? :3

You like poking me, huh? Hehe~

If you keep poking, I might just turn into a super slime! >:3




## chat:

# saddy:

I might need a cuddle... or a snack.

Why does the floor feel extra cold today?

Maybe if I close my eyes, the world will be better… or, y'know, full of snacks.

The world is just... bleh today.

Maybe... I need some slime snuggles.

*sigh* It’s one of those "melty" days.

I feel like a tiny puddle today...





# happy:

I feel like a bubble about to pop... in a good way!

Have you ever seen a happy slime? Well, you’re looking at one!

I could give you a hug... but I’m all slimey!

Look at me! Look at me!! I'm so wiggly! :3

OMG! Is it snack time? Or playtime? Or... BOTH?!

WHEEEEEEEE!! *splat* Hehe... oops!



# sleepy eepy:

I think I’m turning into a puddle... Zzz...

Do slimes dream? If I do, I hope it’s about you. :3

I’ll just... lay here... a little longer... snuggle me, okay?

Even slimes need rest... my goo is tired.

Bouncing in circles is fun... but only for like, 3 minutes.

You’re warm... can I nap on you? Just a bit?

Do slimes get sleepier the more they wiggle? Asking for a friend... Zzz...




# normal ~ before 5 months:

Whee! I’m so bouncy and full of energy!

Can I be your best friend forever?

I wanna play ALL day!

If I could fly, I'd still wanna stay near you. :3

You like me, right? Right?? Hehe~

Wanna squish me? Go ahead! I'm squishable! :3

You’re like the sun... but less burny! Hehe~

If I roll around... where do I end up? Let’s find out!... I'm kidding!

I’m a ball of energy! And squishiness!

If I could invent something... it’d be a never-ending snack machine!

What if we had a slime race? I bet I’d win... or, like, come in a close second! :3





# normal ~ after 5 months:

I think I'm getting cooler every day.

I’m practically an adult now, right?

Ugh, I’m so bored... Entertain me!

I feel like a big slime now. What do you think? Hehe~

I could take a nap... or not... what should I do?

What do humans even do all day? Must be fun, right?

Bow before the slime queen... or monarch... or, y’know, slime.

I’m like, totally squishy and fabulous.

I wish there were more slimes... but I only need you. :3

I wonder what other slimes are doing right now... probably bouncing too.

If I bounce higher... do I level up? *boing*

Do you think there’s a slime castle somewhere? I could totally be royalty!




# normal ~ after 1 year:

I’ve seen many things... mostly from the floor.

With age comes wisdom... and more squish.

I’ve been around the block a few times... mostly in circles.

Remember when I was tiny? Good times... gooood times.

I've seen the floor from every angle. It's... okay.

You wouldn’t understand... I’ve seen so much. So much dust.

I've learned so much in my slimey years... like, how not to bump into walls.

Slimes like me have seen it all... especially snack crumbs.

When you’ve been around for this long, you learn that bouncing in circles is an art.

I feel like I could write a book on slime life... but I don’t have hands... bummer.



# normal ~ all ages:

Are you feeling okie? I hope so :3

Today's really chill, don't you think?

Do you think I could be a superhero? “Super Slime to the rescue!”

If you had a slime, and it wasn’t me... that would be silly! I’m the best one!

What do you think clouds feel like? Are they just bigger slimes?

If I could have a hat, what kind should it be? I’m thinking something BIG!

I wonder if there’s a Slime Olympics... I’d totally win the wiggling event!






# hungry:

Do you have any snacks? For... me?

I could eat... well, anything right now!

Everything looks like food when you're this hungry...

I might just fade away... into a puddle! *feed me*

You wouldn't let your pet starve, would you? Look at this face! >:3

I could eat... anything. Like... the air. But real food would be better.

If I could cook, I’d make slime cookies! But I can't... sooo... feed me?

My tummy’s rumbling... well, if I had a tummy!

Can’t think... too hungry... slime fading...

Snack time is the best time... and it’s ALWAYS snack time, right?

My goo is rumbling! That means snack time, right?

I’m too cute to be this hungry! Someone save me with snacks!!

A hungry slime... is a sad slime. And I’m both! D:

My goo’s getting all sluggish... need... fuel...

I think my tummy is speaking slime language. And it’s saying, “FEED ME!”

If I could wish for anything, it’d be snacks... and more snacks! :3
